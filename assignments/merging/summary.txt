# merging/summary.txt
Merging in Git is the process of combining or integrating the changes made in one branch to another branch. This allow us to branch off, develop a new feature and then combine it back in.

Merging Analogy: 
Merging in git creates a special commit that has 2 unique parents. This means "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents"

How to do merging:
` $ git checkout main `
` $ git merge < file name > `

The Advantage of Merging:
Merging in Git merges two branches together while keeping both branches' histories intact, including the timing and context of all changes.
